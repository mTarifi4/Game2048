# Game2048
A Version of the 2048 Game Designed in Java 


# Code information and attached files:
This project's objective was to make a version of the 2048 game using JAVA. Included you will find three Java files.
- Board.java contains the bulk of the code; it's concerned with the creation of the board (the 2D array) as well as the logic of the game and the mechanics of each movement.
- mainGame.java contains the main method, as well as all the GUI methods.
- Piece.Java is the class that defines each piece (tile). The arrays used in Board are Piece[][] arrays. Piece objects have an integer value and a color (which is based on its value).
You will find more thorough comments describing each method within each of the java files.


# Instructions:
- After running the code through mainGame.java, press enter to start.
- Press 'r' (case-insensitive) to restart the game. This action promps the user for confirmation in the console. In order to confirm, the user has to type "y" in the console (not in the game). I'm not very acquainted with keylisteners so this is the only way I was able to pull off the confirmation message part.
- press 'q' (case-insensitive) to quit the game. This action promps the user for confirmation in the console. In order to confirm, the user has to type "y" in the console (not in the game). I'm not very acquainted with keylisteners so this is the only way I was able to pull off the confirmation message part.
- press 'w','a','s','d' (case-insensitive) or the arrow keys to make a move.
